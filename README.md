# Online News Popularity

This project has been realized during my Master degree's first year in collaboration with @LeaBrasseur and it's our first machine learning project using R.
The dataset refers to articles published by website [Mashable](https://mashable.com/) with their caracteristics and the number of shares as our dependant variable. The aim of this project is then to predict whether an article tends to be popular or unpopular using machine learning and which model is more accurate.
